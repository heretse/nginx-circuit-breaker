# Circuit Breaker pattern with NGINX
Let's see how to set up NGINX to implement [the circuit breaker pattern](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html) so that when upstream servers start to fail, nginx won't keep trying to connect to them, wasting precious time on each request. Instead, after a couple of retries, nginx will automatically send an error response. It'll try to connect to the failing upstream again after a while, to see if it's been recovered from the outage.

## Scenario
In a microservice architecture, we have two different services listening for http requests: `service1` and `service2`. These services always send the same response to every request: either `200 OK` responses that take 1 second to build, or `500 Server Error` responses that take 3 seconds to build if we toggle the error mode. We can toggle the error mode on and off just sending a `POST` request.

To achieve high availability, each of these services has three different servers.
All requests coming from the outside go through our API Gateway front server: an NGINX server routing traffic to our microservices based on the subdomain.

## Testing the scenario
When the service is failing, clients need to wait several seconds to get the error response. But when NGINX *opens the circuit* between itself and the failing upstream server, it sends the error response **in just a few milliseconds**.

### Building our infrastructure
Let's bring our infrastructure up

```bash
$ make up
```

### Sending requests to our services
Let's send requests to test it
